Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2\. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0\. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
```

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   -10<sup>4</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>4</sup>
